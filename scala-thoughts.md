It was interesting working in scala.  I would say there are two big things that
I think this assignment help me learn: syntax and built in functions.  Reviewing
the solution code helped me understand the style some as well, but I think the
key things for learning a langauge are being able to do things in it and to do
things I really needed to understand how to do proper syntax and what commands I
had to invent and which were already there.  Collections assignment was a good
example of where I was mostly using the build in features to good affect, but
would sometimes find that the sample solution made use of a built in function
that I didn't think would exist and had instead already built my own.

Functional coding is relatively easy in scala.  I love programming functionally
so this was quite nice to see and was a fun reminder.  I especially liked getting
to play with functions like fold, map, and filter since they are so powerfully
but in a normal context I tend to use loops and don't end up playing with them.

It is very interesting how much scala can figure out in the ways of implied ;
and {} and whatnot.  I'm currently not in love with the best practice of ommiting
things, especially things like curley braces because I think a function that
then has an if and few else ifs and an else would look clearer/nicer with curley
braces but as is it seems to be Scala best practice to ommit anything you can.
On the other hand I do like the look of python without all the curley braces and
whatnot, so perhaps it will grow on me.  Not particularly from this assignment,
but from the various things we've done in class I think it's super cool how
flexible Scala is. While it is a bit weird to have a million ways to say the same
thing, the flexibility of the language is super cool.

Going forward I'd love to do more functional programming scala style and learn
more about what kind of things are fun to do functionally in scala.
